# Microsoft Graph Capabilities â€“ 400 Level
----------------
In this lab, you will walk through capabilities of the Microsoft Graph to build applications to understand the capabilities of Microsoft Graph. 

## Prerequisites

This lab uses Visual Studio 2017. It also requires an Office 365 subscription and a user with administrative privileges. This lab also requires a Microsoft Azure subscription. If you do not have an Azure subscription, get started by creating a [Free Azure Subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).

## 1. Microsoft Graph delta queries

This lab will walk you through developing an application using delta queries with Microsoft Graph to request changes to resources.

### Register and grant consent to the application

Visit the [Application Registration Portal](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com). **Register** a new Converged application, and copy the generated application ID for later use.  **Configure** the application:

- **Generate** a new application password secret. Copy it for later use.
- Add a **Native** application platform. Copy the generated URL for later use.
- Add an **application** permission for the `User.ReadWrite.All` scope. 
- Make sure to **Save** all changes

![](../../Images/01.png)

The application requests an application permission with the User.ReadWrite.All scope. This permission requires administrative consent. **Copy** the following URL and **replace** the `{clientId}` placeholder with your application's client ID from the application registration portal.

````
https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/adminconsent?client_id={clientId}&redirect_uri=http://localhost
````

**Paste** the resulting URL into a browser. You are prompted to sign in. You must sign in as an administrative user.

![](../../Images/02.png)

After signing in, you are prompted to consent to permission requests to read and write all users' full profiles and to sign in and read the current user's profile. Click **Accept**.

> **Note:** There is approximately a 20 minute data replication delay between the time when an application is granted admin consent and when the data can successfully synchronize. For more information, see: https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-daemon-v2/issues/1

You will receive an error indicating a bad request. This is expected. You did not create a web application to listen for HTTP requests on localhost, Azure AD is telling you that it cannot redirect to the requested URL. Building a web application for admin consent is out of scope for this lab. However, the URL in the browser shows that Azure AD is telling you that admin consent has been granted via the "admin_consent=True" in the URL bar.

### Create a new console application
In Visual Studio 2017, create a new console application named **UsersDeltaQuery**.

![](../../Images/05.png)

**Right-click** the project and choose **Manage NuGet Packages**. 

Click the **Browse** tab in the NuGet Package Manager window. Ensure the **Include prerelease** checkbox is checked.

**Search** for and install the following NuGet packages:
- `Microsoft.Graph` 
- `Microsoft.Identity.Client`

**Right-click** the References node in the project and choose **Add Reference**. **Add** a reference for `System.Configuration`.

**Edit** the `App.config` file and provide the settings from your registered application.

````xml
<add key="clientId" value="" />         <!-- ex: c7d838fa-8885-442d-889c-7d25567dd2c1 -->
<add key="clientSecret" value="" />     <!-- ex: ehY7gK57f!29 -->
<add key="tenantId" value="" />         <!-- ex: contoso.onmicrosoft.com -->
````

**Edit** the `Program.cs` file and replace its contents.

````csharp

### Run the application
Now that the application is written and configured, run the application to test it and observe its behavior.

Your application will make a delta query request to the Microsoft Graph for users. The first query will return all users because you do not yet have a deltaLink to query. 

![](../../Images/06.png)

In order to force a change, you will add a new user using the Microsoft Graph API. Because these are asyncronous methods the code execution will pause waiting for you to press a key to continue. This allows you to verify that the newly created `UsersDeltaQuery Demo User` user has been added to your tenant before executing the delta query.

You can uncomment the lines in the method that displays the user data to also show the nextLink, skipToken, and deltaLink values.

![](../../Images/07.png)

Another delta query request is made to the Microsoft Graph against the Users resource, this time using the deltaQuery. Only the newly added user is returned.

![](../../Images/08.png)

Finally, the newly created user is deleted.
